A collection of projects I never finished. Mostly from GameMaker. Feel free to do whatever you want with them.

# World Generator
Generates world maps using different algorithms.

# Herogen v2
The general idea is sort of an extension of the world generator but into a game. You first generate the map, but this time with more control of the height map and biomes.
Then, you spawn into the world as a human. You're able to pick up rocks (hold space) and throw them at other humans that spawn (hold right click then left click). They can also pick
up and throw rocks. The grass area spawns trees and the mountain area spawns rocks. The dirt and snow biomes are empty. I'm not sure if I ever implemented the fish spawning
in the water.
