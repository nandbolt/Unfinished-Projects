A collection of projects I never finished. Mostly from GameMaker. Feel free to do whatever you want with them.

# World Generator
Generates world maps using different algorithms.

# Herogen v2
The general idea is sort of an extension of the world generator but into a game. You first generate the map, but this time with more control of the height map and biomes.
Then, you spawn into the world as a human. You're able to pick up rocks (hold space) and throw them at other humans that spawn (hold right click then left click). They can also pick
up and throw rocks. The grass area spawns trees and the mountain area spawns rocks. The dirt and snow biomes are empty. I'm not sure if I ever implemented the fish spawning
in the water.

# Coin Collector v1
A simple 2D platformer about collecting coins. It was actually the precursor to the graphing calculator game I made. There's a wall jump, hold jump and a dash off the wall by
pressing the opposite direction and jumping. I think the goal is to see how fast you can collect 20 coins. There's also music and sfxs!

# Coin Collector v2
A more refined version of Coin Collector v1, with smoother platforming, more dash mechanics, a bigger level with a tutorial area, main area and secret area. Contains buttons
that have game modes. Pressing multiple times cycles the mode (Collect 20, Collect 50, Collect Infinite, Collect Trail).

# They Will Kill Me v1
I think the goal of this was to have a the human character be autonomous and look for food and water. Then, the player would focus on changing the world and seeing how it
affected the behavior of the human. The food and water spawn at random locations once collected and the human will try to get to them when they're hungry/thirsty.

# They Will Kill Me v2
This one has very similar logic to the first version, but you click where you want to go and a zombie follows you. There is also a swimming area.

# They Will Kill Me v3
Very similar to the first and second more more flushed out. Human needs food and water while zombie needs human flesh. You can spawn in zombies with energy.
