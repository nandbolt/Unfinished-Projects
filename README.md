A collection of projects I never finished. Mostly from GameMaker. Feel free to do whatever you want with them.

# World Generator
Generates world maps using different algorithms.

# Herogen v2
The general idea is sort of an extension of the world generator but into a game. You first generate the map, but this time with more control of the height map and biomes.
Then, you spawn into the world as a human. You're able to pick up rocks (hold space) and throw them at other humans that spawn (hold right click then left click). They can also pick
up and throw rocks. The grass area spawns trees and the mountain area spawns rocks. The dirt and snow biomes are empty. I'm not sure if I ever implemented the fish spawning
in the water.

# Coin Collector v1
A simple 2D platformer about collecting coins. It was actually the precursor to the graphing calculator game I made. There's a wall jump, hold jump and a dash off the wall by
pressing the opposite direction and jumping. I think the goal is to see how fast you can collect 20 coins. There's also music and sfxs!
